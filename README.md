### Minimal dependencies

Only import the official Vue.js library and the ElementUI components to give you the freedom to play.

According to the actual experience of the development, a reasonable and clear directory structure was designed.

### View Layout

Use Vue Router nested routes and ElementUI built-in components for application's layout.

### Data Processing

Add separate api and service layers to abstract the business logic from the components.

All routes support configurable interceptors. User login authentication and role authentication are currently built in.
